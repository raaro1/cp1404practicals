# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I would say 60 - 70% for each practical task.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

At the start as mentioned before I would skim read the practical and skip out on important information, to get a quicker estimate accuracy but that would usually backfire.
But later I started to properly read through the practical and starting getting faster times.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt that I take a lot longer on task that I skim read and try to be fast as possible in. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learnt how to implement others feedback into my code to further improve it.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learnt how to properly break down code and how to improve them by giving meaningful feedback.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code Review 1](https://github.com/marysvineeta/cp1404practicals/pull/1#pullrequestreview-3497665933)

### Explanation

I went through each file looking for what to fix, however their where just copied demos fom the practicals,
so I couldn't give any meaningful comments.


## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Nothing really, I enjoy how the subject is currently structured.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I would say submitting on time would be something I did really well consistently.
